     Hello. I am <span itemprop="name">Tommy Anderberg</span>. The photo shows me trying to smile into a camera at 3 am on 
	 December 12, 2010, because a PR person wanted me to. <del>Five</del> Nine years on, I like to tell myself that I don't 
	 look all that different.
     </p>
     <p>
     This is a personal site where I sometimes post or link to things I've done or found worthy of note. Unless you are an old 
	 friend looking for trouble, you are probably here for one of these:
     </p>
	 <ul>
		<li><p>
		What I'm up to these days. Lately mostly messing around with 
		<a href="../ml/faces/index.html" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and thinking about 
		<a href="http://www.fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2077" target="_blank">the</a> 
		<a href="../stories/retro/index.html" target="_blank">future</a>. 
		Maybe someday I will have something more to say about it.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
		My forays into <a href="../vr/bw/index.html" target="_blank">virtual worlds</a>, from <a href="../htg/why/index.html" target="_blank">2010</a> 
		<a href="https://bitbucket.org/tanderberg/realsense-for-singularity" target="_blank">onwards</a>. So far only 
		an occasional hobby, but the advent of affordable virtual reality hardware could perhaps change that. (If you are looking
		for a <a href="#" class="tooltip">certain penguin<span><img class="tooltip_callout" src="../css/tooltip_callout.gif" style="margin: auto" />
		<img src="tuxlom.png" /></span></a>, I am afraid I tired of unbreaking it every time a browser vendor updated its WebGL 
		implementation.)
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
		The handful of papers I wrote about cosmological consequences of the Higgs mechanism from 2005 to 2012, when the LHC 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDNP9KOEdh0&t=1m46s" target="_blank">spoiled the party</a>. 
		Long story short, the suggestion that electroweak symmetry breaking could explain away the luminosity deficit of 
		distant supernovae without accelerated expansion did not work out, mainly due to an attractor which I eventually found 
		lurking in the low energy limit of the Standard Model. You can read about it 
		<a href="http://www.fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1462" target="_blank">here</a>, see it in action
		<a href="http://simplicial.net/hanlon/" target="_blank">here</a> and find out more 
		<a href="http://www.figshare.com/authors/Tommy_Anderberg/537629" target="_blank">here</a>. While the many excuses used to dismiss 
		the idea out of hand were not overly insightful, I did learn one important thing from them: 
		<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/crunch_art.html" target="_blank">Goodstein was right</a>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
		The audio and music software I developed in the mid-90s to early 00s. It's all retired now; that market was killed long ago by a 
		flood of free- and demoware. The <a href="http://www.polyhedric.com/software/" target="_blank">old site</a> is still up for nostalgic 
		reasons, but the downloads are history. The <a href="http://www.polyhedric.com/software/amazon/index.htm" target="_blank">list of books</a> on 
		digital signal processing, audio and music programming may still be useful.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
		The articles I wrote about personal computing and the Internet back when that was news (mid- to late 90s). Most are buried in 
		archives now, but I recently stumbled upon an ambitious effort to digitize the Norwegian edition of 
		<a href="http://www.stone-oakvalley-studios.com/0009_09_dashboard_index.php" target="_blank">Tekno magazine</a>, which featured 
		translations from the original Swedish of a fair amount of things I wrote. I make my first appearance in that collection on p. 30 
		of #3/1996 (<a href="http://www.stone-oakvalley-studios.com/uploads/04dc598d/tekno_03_1996.pdf" target="_blank">PDF link</a>).
